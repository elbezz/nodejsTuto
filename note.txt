%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
in order to save our files into a database directely instead in the server we're gonna use a library called "fileponde" witch make uploading our files much easier and allows us to have a very cool file preview in the browser
in order to use filepond we need to go to the documentation page and download the cdn witch we can include in our project 
go to: https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/getting-started/installation/javascript/

copy the cdn:
<link href="https://unpkg.com/filepond@^4/dist/filepond.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/filepond@^4/dist/filepond.js"></script>
and include it in the layout section: layout.ejs

also we need to download some other cdn for the previewgo to:
https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/file-encode/
and copy the cdn
<script src="https://unpkg.com/filepond-plugin-file-encode/dist/filepond-plugin-file-encode.js"></script>
also download image preview pluging from
https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/image-preview/

copy the stylesheet and the script
<link
    href="https://unpkg.com/filepond-plugin-image-preview/dist/filepond-plugin-image-preview.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/filepond-plugin-image-preview/dist/filepond-plugin-image-preview.js"></script>

also download the image resize pluging: we don't want to store huge images in our server
